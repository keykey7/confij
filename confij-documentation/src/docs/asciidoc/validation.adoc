== JSR303 Validator

NOTE: JSR303 Validator format requires the `{group}:confij-validation` maven artifact.

Straight forward http://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate-Validation].
Validation is applied to the configuration as a last step after templating.

WARNING: `{group}:confij-validation` depends on `hibernate-validator` >= 6.1 in order to support non-getter properties

== Logging

ConfiJ core relies on `java.util.logging` (JUL) ony due to it's zero-dependency strategy.
If `{group}:confij-slf4j` is found on the classpath, logging uses the slf4j-framework.
To support a custom logging-framework, register a <<serviceloader>> for `ConfijLogFactory`.
