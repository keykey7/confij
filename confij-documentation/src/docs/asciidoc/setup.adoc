<1> Define your configuration type, in this case as a Java-interface
<2> Load from various sources, in this case from a properties file
<3> Bind the source to a configuration instance of matching type

The corresponding properties file must have the same attributes as in the interface.
ConfiJ will make sure that no unknown keys are present and bind all configuration strings to their configuration types.
