== Repository
ConfiJ maven artifacts are available on Bintray/JCenter.
A Gradle setup looks like:
[source,groovy,subs=attributes]
----
repositories {
   jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile '{group}:confij-core:{revnumber}'
}
----

== Quick Start
[source]
----
include::{src}[tag=simple_interface,indent=0]
include::{src}[tag=simple_builder,indent=0]
----
<1> Define your configuration type, in this case as a Java-interface
<2> Load from various source, in this case a properties file
<3> Bind the source to a configuration instance of matching type
----
include::{home}/server.properties[]
----

ConfiJ will make sure that no unknown keys are present and bind all configuration strings to their configuration types.
